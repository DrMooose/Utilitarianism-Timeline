                <p>The ethic, categorical imperative, is looking to do the right thing, no matter the case. The content of the Ron Haviv’s photograph is not what would fall under the ethic, but rather the actions taken by Haviv to acquire the photo. The displayed image was taken before the war in Bosnia, showing a Serbian man kicking a Muslim woman who had been shot by the mulita group. Haviv was allowed to follow the nationalist mulita group, Tigers, but was warned not to captured any of the killings. Even though he knew the risk, Haviv willingly put himself in danger to capture the atrocities that was happening in Bosnia. The photographs that Haviv was able to acquire were later used as evidence against the group for their pursuit of ethnic cleansing. Haviv did not endanger himself for personal gain, but because he believed that what he was doing was the right thing to do.</p>
