                <p>In Tim Jankowiak article over Immanuel Kant, they describe Kant's study over the categorical imperative ethic with the sentence, "Kant’s ethics are organized around the notion of a 'categorical imperative,' which is a universal ethical principle stating that one should always respect the humanity in others, and that one should only act in accordance with rules that could hold for everyone" (n.d., para 2). Thus the ethic can be seen as an individual looking to do the right thing, no matter the case. The content of Ron Haviv’s photograph is not what would fall under the ethic, but rather the actions that were taken by Haviv to acquire the photo. The displayed image was taken before the war in Bosnia, showing a Serbian man kicking a Muslim woman who had been shot by the mulita group. Haviv was allowed to follow the nationalist mulita group, Tigers, but was warned not to capture any of the killings. Even though he knew the risk, Haviv willingly put himself in danger to capture the atrocities that were happening in Bosnia. The photographs that Haviv was able to acquire were later used as evidence against the group for their pursuit of ethnic cleansing. Haviv did not endanger himself for personal gain, but because he believed that what he was doing was the right thing to do.</p>
