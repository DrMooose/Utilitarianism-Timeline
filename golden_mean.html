                <p>The Golden Mean is to find a balance between two extremes. It is not finding the good between right and wrong but finding the middle ground between two sides. The story involving Gonzalo Orquín's "Si, Quiero" series may not be a clear example of the golden mean, but the results of the actions from the two sides could fall under it. The photos for Orquin's series show same-sex and heterosexual couples kissing inside catholic churches. The gallery was to be shown in Italy, but representatives from the Vatican forced the exhibit to be shut down. Orquin was later able to present his exhibit at the Leslie-Lohman Museum of Gay and Lesbian Art in Manhatten. The reason this situation could fall under the golden mean ethic is that each side in some form got what they wanted. The Vatican felt they succeeded by shutting down the gallery in Italy and in their eyes, protecting the image of the church. On the other end, Orquin was still able to release his photographs and present the message he wanted to for the LGBTQ community. Neither side fully got what they wanted, but neither side was completely removed. So in a way, this can be seen as them being balanced. Again, this is not to say that either side is right or wrong, but that a balance between the two sides is perceived.</p>
