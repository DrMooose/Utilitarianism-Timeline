                    <p>The golden rule is to treat others as one would want to be treated. It is thinking about how others might feel from your actions and vice versa. The circumstance around Thomas Hoepker's photo serves as a case to what the golden rule can be. When first viewing the image, it appears as though the individuals in the image are indifferent to the tragedy that is happening behind them or have already moved on from caring. In an article by Jonathan Jones (2011, para 4) writes, "Rich's view of the picture was instantly disputed. Walter Sipser, identifying himself as the guy in shades at the right of the picture, said he and his girlfriend, apparently sunbathing on a wall, were in fact "in a profound state of shock and disbelief". Hoepker, they both complained, had photographed them without permission in a way that misrepresented their feelings and behavior." With the release of this photo, some viewers were offended by what seems to be the groups lack of concern. If these people were to follow the golden rule though, they would not cast judgment so quickly and instead think of how it would feel to be judged by others from a single photograph. The photo is an indication to not form a hard belief around an image, without at least being given some type of context first.</p>
