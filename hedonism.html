                <p>The ethic hedonism is to hold an opinion or action that is only for one's personal gain. An example of a hedonistic act can be seen in a photo taken by Brain Walski, of the Los Angeles Times. The photograph he captures appears to show a British soldier gesturing for Iraqi civilians to get down and take cover. This is not the true image though. The actual photo is a combination of 2 photographs that Walski took at that time. The altered photo gives a more dramatic narrative to the actions that are occurring in the image. It paints the British soldier as a courageous figure looking after the civilian, instead of a soldier standing watch. It changes the feelings that the viewer may have when viewing the original images vs, the altered one. Walski's actions in altering the image are to only benefit his popularity as a photographer. He does not take into account or does not care about the possible consequences from him altering this image.</p>
