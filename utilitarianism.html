                <p>The ethical view of utilitarianism is that the suffering of a few is acceptable if it benefits the masses in the end. The philosophy's belief is not that others suffering is not important, but that sometimes it may be warranted to help push a bigger cause. Julia Driver outlines the ethic with the sentence, "Though there are many varieties of the view discussed, utilitarianism is generally held to be the view that the morally right action is the action that produces the most good" (2014, para 2). Eddie Adams work during the Vietnam war are horrifying examples of what utilitarianism can be. His photo depicting General Nguyen Ngoc Loan executing Viet Cong prisoner Nguyen Van Lem is a gruesome image of the war was. Its publicization shocked many as its graphic content was part of a dark reality that some never wanted to be exposed to. Even though the image was seen as controversial by some, it did bring awareness to the brutality of the war and affected the publics' view of the US involvement.</p>
