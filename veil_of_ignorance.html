                <p>Hedonism is ____. An example of an hedonism _____ can be seen in a photo taken by Brain Walski, of the Los Angeles Times. The photograph he captures appears to show a British soldier gesturing for Iraqi civilians to get down and take cover. This is not the true image though. The actual photo is a combination of 2 photographs that Walski took at that time. The altered photo gives a more dramatic narrative to the actions that are occurring in the image. It paints the British soldier as a courageous figure looking after the civilian, instead of a soldier standing watch. It changes the feelings that the viewer may have when viewing the original images vs, the altered one.</p>
