                <p>Veil of ignorance is to view all as equal regardless of age, gender, or ethnicty. It is to think of others as yourself and to show proper respect to an individual or group. Alessio Mamo project "Dreaming Food" is an example that can fall under this philosophy. The collection of images show indian villagers covering their eyes while standing infront of a table full of food. The original intent of the images was to raise awarness to food waste and struggles of others. What is instead shown are images that seem to be mocking and belittling the poor. Sushmita Pathak (2018, para 6) tells of an account from Amitabh Behar, the CEO of Oxfam India, "...that he believes Mamo's 'intent was right, to shock people into making the right choice of not wasting food.' But he said the photos were not 'sensitive enough of the realities of poor people.'"</p>
